This practice project was intended to showcase how to connect your own UI to a public API. Though the code is written in imperative and cumbersome style, it mainly demonstrates DOM manipulation skills.

There is a mini node js backend, where API_KEY is stored, and 3 relevant endpoints are being called every 15 minutes (number of free API calls is limited). Then frontend app is connected to that mini-backend, which is hosted on [Render](https://render.com/), `so please be patient if the loading takes some time...`

Public API belongs to [https://coinmarketcap.com/]

Finished in march 2020.
